         proper tap technique, producing clear tap sounds, and having fun.</p>
    <h2>Hip Hop</h2>
    <p>Hip hop is a high-energy class that will encourage students to step outside <br>
     of the box by bringing their own individual style and personality to the movements. <br>
      Hip hop dance requires students to have the strength and stamina to successfully perform moves. <br>
       Therefore class includes upper and lower body conditioning as well as a rigorous warm-up to help <br>
       prepare students for more intense movements.</p><br></br>
